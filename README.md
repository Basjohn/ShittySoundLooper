# Shitty Sound Looper

A simple utility for creating seamless shitty audio loops. This tool analyzes audio files to find optimal loop points that create smooth, continuous playback without noticeable breaks. Ideal for passing out to in a pool of your own urine. Slightly less effective in other people's urine.

## Features

- Automatic zero-crossing detection for seamless loops
- Supports 2 simultaneous loops with minimal resource usage.
- System tray integration for background playback
- Independant volume control for both streams
- Support for WAV and MP3 and OGG files
- Modern customizable UI with dark mode and only dark mode because this app is going through its hot goth girl phase.
- 6 included royalty free loops for non-commercial use
- Ability to remember and adjust even system volume so you can get back into whatever shit you're into instantly.
- Optional sleep/hibernation prevention/suppression to not interrupt you as you peak zen with the now self-aware urine cloud.

## Installation

### Installation Steps - Skip for Windows

For NIX
Download/Clone all files, and then run "chmod +x build_linux.sh && ./build_linux.sh"

For MacOS
Regret your weirdasschoices and also run "chmod +x build_macos.sh && ./build_maco"
(With all files downloaded/cloned)

For WIN
Just go to the releases section. Run the portable EXE. Rub gelatine in your armpits while speaking Italian.

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Click "Browse" to select an audio file
3. Once processed, click "Play" to start the looped playback
4. Adjust volume using the slider
5. Minimize to system tray to keep playing in background

The app is designed to be stable so you don't wake up until the piss is dry. 
I have included several sample loops and credited them.
One is sampled from myself and the others free for non-commercial use.
(I suggest Deep)

Theoretically this should also work with simple music like lofi shit when you need to enter a gen z trance or something.
